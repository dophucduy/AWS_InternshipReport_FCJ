Structure-based drug design involves using computational tools primarily to answer this question!\nChugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a leading Japanese pharmaceutical company, specializes in research, development, manufacturing, and marketing of prescription drugs in the fields of oncology, immunology/allergy, neurology, and kidney disease. In an effort to advance molecular research through quantum computing technology, Chugai has partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to explore the application of quantum-compatible computational techniques to cyclic peptide simulation, aiming to accelerate drug discovery.\nPeptides are short chains of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds, typically containing about 2–50 amino acid residues. Cyclic peptides are peptides with a closed ring structure. Although cyclic peptide drugs have many advantages over traditional small molecules [1, 2], simulating their docking with exogenous proteins is time-consuming and error-prone due to the larger number of rotational bonds.\nIn this article, we summarize AWS\u0026rsquo;s efforts in collaboration with Chugai to construct the cyclic peptide docking problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, which is suitable for quantum computing. Modeling the problem as QUBO allows the application of both classical and quantum optimization methods, such as classical and quantum annealing, to optimize peptide particle positions. We also developed a Constraint Programming (CP) model used as a baseline method. These methods were tested on example cases from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and we used an end-to-end framework to predict the three-dimensional structure of multiple cyclic peptides in environments with exogenous proteins. Both methods successfully predicted configurations, however, the QUBO-based method encountered scalability limitations when exceeding six peptides and 34 protein residues, while the CP method could solve all cases in the test set.\nFor more details, please refer to our scientific paper published in Scientific Reports.\nRepresentation of cyclic peptides and exogenous proteins\nTo represent peptides, we use a \u0026ldquo;coarse-grained\u0026rdquo; representation for each amino acid, where main atoms and side chains are represented by single particles. We use two particles for all amino acids except Glycine, which has no side chain and therefore requires only a single particle (Figure 1).\nFigure 1 – Example of coarse-grained representation of Glycine (G) with 1 particle and Lysine (K) with 2 particles. Blue is used for the main chain, and green for the side chain.\nWe place these peptide particles on a three-dimensional tetrahedral lattice, as illustrated in Figure 2. Interactions between amino residues are calculated using the Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) potential [3]. The goal is to find the optimal arrangement of particles on the lattice such that the total interaction energy is minimized, while ensuring cyclization conditions and avoiding particle overlap.\nFigure 2 – Feasible arrangement of cyclic peptide P-K-I-D-N-G on a tetrahedral lattice, with blue representing the main chain and green representing side chains. The cyclization bond is colored red. Some free vertices of the tetrahedral lattice are illustrated in white.\nWe only consider the \u0026ldquo;active site\u0026rdquo; of the target protein – a concentrated region where the peptide is likely to bind. This helps reduce the problem space and increase the likelihood of finding the optimal peptide orientation. To identify the active site in the target protein, we identify amino residues within a specified distance (in this case 5Å) from the peptide\u0026rsquo;s amino residues. The protein affects the peptide on the lattice in two ways: it blocks some positions that are too close (within 3.8Å) where the peptide cannot fit, and it creates interaction regions (within 6.5Å) where protein and peptide can interact. After removing blocked positions, we calculate the energy between each part of the peptide and nearby protein parts at interaction points. The distances chosen for the active site, blocked region, and interaction region will affect the solution the system finds.\nQUBO Model\nWe investigate modeling and solving this problem using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), which is suitable for quantum properties. QUBO is a combinatorial optimization problem aimed at minimizing a quadratic function with binary variables (0 or 1). In this work, we start by representing the problem as high-order binary optimization, then use locality reduction techniques to convert to QUBO form.\nMany Hamiltonian expressions for non-docking protein folding problems have been introduced and analyzed with different encoding strategies. The original work by Perdomo et al. [4] used spatial encoding to map protein positions to a 2D lattice. Later, researchers developed turn encoding methods [5], describing protein shape through sequences of steps, making it more efficient for long proteins. Many groups have improved this method: Babbush et al. [5] created the \u0026ldquo;turn ancilla\u0026rdquo; method, while other groups adapted it for different types of spatial lattices and quantum computing methods.\nOur model is an extension of the \u0026ldquo;resource-efficient\u0026rdquo; turn encoding method [6]. The original model includes interactions between peptides, non-overlap constraints between non-consecutive particles, and no-return constraints to prevent consecutive particles from overlapping. Therefore, the Hamiltonian expression consists of two parts: Hcomb, handling interactions between peptides and non-overlap errors; and Hback, ensuring consecutive particles do not return to the same lattice point. To extend this model to integrate external proteins in cyclic peptides, we add two components: Hcycle to impose peptide cyclization conditions, and Hprotein to handle peptide–protein interactions and steric collisions.\nThe Hcycle component ensures cyclization between specific amino acid pairs by requiring them to be nearest neighbors (1-NN) on the lattice, using the distance function d(x, y) to calculate the number of lattice steps between vertices. For peptide–protein interactions, Hprotein includes MJ interaction energy for peptide residues within the protein\u0026rsquo;s interaction region and penalties for blocked positions due to steric collisions.\nThe final expression combines all components, extending the original model to include cyclization factors and protein interactions:\nH = Hcomb + Hback + Hcycle + Hprotein\nHcomb : Combines interaction energy between peptides with overlap penalties\nHback : Imposes no-return constraints for consecutive particles\nHcycle : Enforces cyclization constraints\nHprotein : Handles peptide–protein interactions and steric collisions\nConstraint Programming (CP) Model\nAs a baseline, we built a Constraint Programming (CP) model for the problem. CP is a method for solving constraint satisfaction and optimization problems, including both problem modeling and backtracking-based solvers. Typically, users describe the problem with specific variables and constraints, then the search process tries different possibilities to find solutions. The term \u0026ldquo;programming\u0026rdquo; here means \u0026ldquo;planning\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;coding.\u0026rdquo;\nMain constraints in the CP model:\nPlace amino residues at valid lattice points, excluding positions affected by steric collisions from external proteins\nMaintain precise distances between bonded amino residues\nPrevent overlap between amino residues\nImpose cyclization bonds between amino residues\nThe model\u0026rsquo;s objective function is to minimize the total MJ interaction energy between adjacent particles. The CP model is designed to optimize interaction energy between amino residues on the lattice while complying with various spatial constraints. CP can flexibly handle logical constraints and nonlinear relationships that linear programming models find difficult to implement. The model ensures amino residues are placed correctly on the lattice, avoiding overlap, and considering interactions within allowable ranges.\nResults\nTo evaluate the methods, we built a comprehensive processing pipeline for protein–peptide complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to predict the optimal three-dimensional structure of bound peptides. The PDB repository contains detailed and standardized atomic coordinates for ring protein complexes. The pipeline consists of the following steps, as illustrated in Figure 3:\nSeparate the PDB file into two parts: peptide and target protein\nIdentify the protein\u0026rsquo;s active site – the concentrated region where the peptide is likely to bind\nClassify each atom in the peptide as main chain or side chain, then calculate the weighted center of mass of each group, creating a 2-particle representation for each amino acid\nCreate a tetrahedral lattice to discretize the search space for discrete optimization methods\nFilter the lattice based on active site coordinates and steric collision radius to remove collision-causing vertices, creating the final lattice structure\nFigure 3 – Conversion from atomic representation to coarse-grained 2-particle representation on tetrahedral lattice\nPDB serves as standard data for comparison with model predictions. However, the tetrahedral lattice has some limitations: actual peptides are not fixed to rigid structures, but their shapes are determined by natural forces. Therefore, comparing predicted structures with actual structures from PDB is not straightforward. Nevertheless, we evaluate the model\u0026rsquo;s solutions based on two criteria: MJ interaction energy value and root mean square distance (RMSD) compared to actual peptide coordinates (from PDB files) in Euclidean space. RMSD measures the average distance between coarse particles of actual peptides and model-generated peptides. Any RMSD value exceeding 4Å is considered insufficiently accurate for practical use.\nPDB Code Peptide Sequence Number of amino residues Peptide External Protein 3WNE P-K-I-D-N-G 6 26 5LSO K-S-R-W-D-E 6 34 3AV9 S-A-K-I-D-N-L-D 8 28 3AVI S-L-K-I-D-N-M-D 8 32 3AVN S-H-K-I-D-N-L-D 8 28 2F58 H-I-G-P-G-R-A-F-G-G-G 11 49 Table 1: Peptide–protein complexes from the RCSB Protein Databank (https://www.rcsb.org/) used for our experimental analysis.\nWe analyzed six peptide–protein complexes from PDB, with peptide amino residue counts ranging from 6 to 11 and protein active site amino residue counts ranging from 26 to 49, as shown in Table 1. For the QUBO model, we applied simulated annealing – a heuristic algorithm, implemented in an open-source Python hybrid framework. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using Bayesian optimization through Amazon SageMaker. The CP model was implemented using the OR-Tools library and solved optimally within a 300-second time limit on Amazon EC2 m5.4xlarge virtual machines.\nPDB ID Without External Protein With External Protein MJ potential RMSD (Å) MJ potential RMSD (Å) QUBO CP QUBO CP QUBO CP QUBO CP 3WNE -1.87 -1.87 10.03 7.77 -28.53 -42.64 8.88 8.48 5LSO -5.93 -5.97 13.31 13.20 -17.93 -23.26 7.68 10.29 3AV9 -6.18 -6.64 11.36 9.92 – -40.44 – 8.98 3AVI -7.43 -8.34 9.65 9.39 – -62.34 – 8.74 3AVN -6.52 -6.88 10.60 10.75 – -55.12 – 8.34 2F58 -6.18 -13.61 11.52 11.39 – -4.02 – 10.42 Table 2: Comparison of MJ interaction energy values and RMSD for QUBO and CP methods, with and without external protein.\nTable 2 compares performance metrics (MJ interaction energy and RMSD) between the two QUBO and CP methods for each peptide, with and without external protein, as there was no benchmark from previous studies to compare our results.\nThe QUBO method found feasible solutions for problems with peptides containing up to 6 amino residues and target proteins with 34 amino residues. A feasible solution is a configuration that satisfies all problem constraints but may not be optimal in terms of MJ interaction energy. However, for larger cases, QUBO often struggled and produced solutions that violated constraints, because in the QUBO model constraints must be incorporated into the objective function as penalty functions. When there was no external protein, QUBO successfully solved all test cases, achieving the lowest energy scores in 5/6 cases, except for the 2F58 complex which performed worse than CP. Both methods achieved equivalent accuracy (by RMSD) in matching actual structures. However, when protein was present, QUBO only succeeded with 2/5 peptides (3WNE and 5LSO), and achieved higher energy scores than CP in both cases. Notably, QUBO showed higher accuracy than CP for the 5LSO peptide based on RMSD.\nFigure 4 illustrates how both QUBO and CP methods successfully modeled the 5LSO peptide in the presence of protein, producing valid structures compared to the actual structure in the protein database. This shows that optimizing energy scores does not always lead to more accurate structure prediction, especially when starting from non-optimal positions on the tetrahedral lattice model.\nThe CP method showed scalability, solving problems with up to 11 peptide amino residues and 49 target protein amino residues optimally.\nFigure 4: Results image of 5LSO peptide. Comparison of actual peptide in PDB (left) with QUBO model results (center) and CP-MJ 1-NN results (right). Peptides are represented by blue and green dots (corresponding to main chain and side chain), while red dots represent amino residues of the external protein.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we introduced a binary model suitable for quantum properties for the cyclic peptide binding problem. Two QUBO and CP methods were compared on a set of peptide cases, where QUBO found feasible solutions for small problems (up to 6 peptide amino residues and 34 protein amino residues) with competitive MJ interaction energy, while CP showed better scalability by optimally solving larger problems (up to 11 peptide amino residues and 49 protein amino residues), as illustrated in the 5LSO peptide case.\nThe QUBO method worked effectively in protein-free environments, nearly equivalent to CP in solution quality. However, QUBO struggled to ensure feasibility when protein was present, along with inherent challenges in representing distance-dependent interactions in the model, suggesting that QUBO-based quantum optimization techniques may not be the most suitable approach for this specific application. Despite limitations, especially regarding scalability, the QUBO method remains a potential foundation for future research as quantum algorithms and hardware continue to develop.\nThe performance of the CP method also demonstrates the long-term suitability of traditional optimization methods in computational biology. As this field advances, hybrid methods combining quantum and classical techniques may be the most effective choice for solving complex biological molecular modeling problems. Looking ahead, the robust performance and scalability of the CP method make it a promising development direction in peptide–protein interaction research. These findings not only contribute to understanding computational protein modeling but also provide useful guidance for researchers in choosing appropriate methods for similar biological optimization problems.\nThe use of lattice structures to model cyclic peptide binding, while helping to simplify the problem, brings inherent limitations because actual peptides are not constrained to rigid structures but follow natural steric forces. This simplification contributes to significant RMSD (root mean square deviation) values when comparing model results with actual structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\nFor those interested in peptide drug design or computational structural biology, this research provides valuable insights into current algorithmic methods and their associated trade-offs. It also emphasizes the importance of continued research to bridge the gap between simple computational models and the complex reality of biological molecular interactions.

The organization has helped build a more humane world for animals, helping to pass thousands of groundbreaking laws, rescuing hundreds of thousands of individual animals, and caring for and protecting millions more.\nTo address the global challenge of managing street animal populations, Humane World for Animals has developed Humane World Apps—a comprehensive global data management tool designed to improve dog and cat welfare programs through spay and neuter management, mass vaccination, and access to care. With support from the AWS Imagine Grant—a public grant program that provides both cash and Amazon Web Services (AWS) credits to registered nonprofits using cloud technology to advance their mission—Humane World Apps is transforming how large-scale animal welfare programs operate worldwide.\nDuring the beta phase in Vadodara, India, Humane World Apps achieved a dog sterilization rate of up to 86% and a 60% reduction in dog-related complaints after app deployment. This technology aims to end the suffering of companion animals by improving program efficiency, supporting community health, and promoting innovative sustainable solutions to reduce human-dog conflict.\nIn this article, we will present how Humane World Apps is revolutionizing animal welfare management through cloud technology and data-driven solutions.\nFragmented data collection in global animal welfare The scale of the challenge in managing street animal populations is enormous. It is estimated that there are between 700 million and 1 billion dogs worldwide, including both owned and unowned dogs living in shelters, families, or freely in urban and rural environments. According to a MARS study, there are nearly 362 million stray dogs and cats in 20 countries. Communities and government agencies—especially in developing economies—struggle to find reasonable, humane, and accessible solutions to manage dog and cat populations, promote animal welfare, and build peaceful coexistence between companion animals and humans.\nGovernments are responsible for community health and safety, but many places still lack specific solutions and evidence-based programs. Additionally, many places still apply lethal methods to street animals. Long-term solutions including humane and effective sterilization, vaccination, and access to affordable veterinary services are key to improving animal welfare and reducing human-companion animal conflict in areas with stray animal problems.\nHistory shows that large-scale dog and cat welfare programs often struggle due to ineffective, fragmented data management and collection. The consequence is suboptimal results in controlling stray dog and cat populations and addressing community health issues.\nBuilding a comprehensive solution on AWS The goal of Humane World Apps is to provide a unified, high-tech platform that integrates data management systems for activities such as spay and neuter, mass vaccination, and veterinary clinic operations. The application includes both mobile applications and web interfaces, providing advanced features tailored to each program\u0026rsquo;s needs.\nThe mobile application aims to support field teams in collecting real-time data and recording capture locations to ensure dogs are returned to their original locations. The system is expected to track the entire care cycle, including pre- and post-surgical care, surgical data, and image identification to monitor individual animals as well as program outcomes. Users can expect the application to manage rabies vaccination programs through geo-fencing, GPS positioning, and automatic reporting features.\nSince Humane World for Animals is a nonprofit organization, the initial beta version of the application was built on a limited budget. Some developers were volunteers, and they designed and built the application architecture using free or low-cost services. With support from the AWS Imagine Grant (Amazon Web Services\u0026rsquo; grant program for nonprofits), the organization is now in the process of transitioning the beta application to AWS services to unify and simplify the technology system.\nCurrently, the application is designed to use a single Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) server to host both production and testing environments. Additionally, database servers for production and testing environments use Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). The application uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to store animal images. During the transition, the organization has begun using Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES), and plans to leverage additional AWS tools in the future.\nTo ensure redundancy, the organization maintains an AWS instance in Ohio for cold standby. The production and testing environments in Northern Virginia currently use Cloudflare CDN, and will be migrated to Amazon CloudFront in the future. LucidScale is used to diagram the entire AWS architecture to help staff understand the system and support future operations.\nExpanding impact through cloud technology Support from the AWS Imagine Grant is helping Humane World for Animals transition from a distributed technology system to a unified system on AWS. The transition from beta architecture to AWS services is designed to promote global deployment capabilities and increase scalability as the team moves toward putting the application into production. The project will continue to advance the organization\u0026rsquo;s mission through results based on actual effectiveness.\nHumane World Apps is currently in the early stages of deployment in multiple countries, building on the success of the beta phase in India. The beta phase provided strong feedback on the application\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness, demonstrating that technology can change animal welfare outcomes when properly deployed and scaled.\nThe web application serves as an administrative center where program managers design and monitor operations, provide feedback to vaccination teams, generate reports, and manage data across multiple regions. This centralized approach allows for better coordination and more efficient resource allocation across global programs.\nAdvice for nonprofit technology deployment Humane World for Animals offers valuable advice for nonprofits starting technology projects. First, they strongly recommend leveraging resources from Amazon, especially guidance from their technical solution architects. Second, they emphasize staying focused on the ultimate goal—when facing difficulties, remember the project\u0026rsquo;s impact on the lives of street dogs. Finally, they emphasize the importance of implementing software development lifecycle processes early. Establishing source code control and error and requirement prioritization systems before starting is crucial, as implementing them midway consumed valuable time from the grant funding. Although the challenges were significant, the organization\u0026rsquo;s commitment to improving animal welfare worldwide drove them to overcome obstacles and build a scalable, effective solution.\nThe success of Humane World Apps demonstrates the transformative power of cloud technology in addressing global challenges. By leveraging AWS services and the AWS Imagine Grant, Humane World for Animals has created a platform that not only improves animal welfare outcomes but also serves as a model for other nonprofits looking to scale their impact through technology.\nAs the organization continues to expand its reach and refine its platform, the lessons learned from this implementation will undoubtedly benefit the broader animal welfare community. The combination of innovative technology, dedicated volunteers, and strategic partnerships has created a powerful tool for creating positive change in the lives of animals worldwide.\nThe future of animal welfare programs lies in data-driven approaches that can adapt to local needs while maintaining global standards. Humane World Apps represents a significant step forward in this direction, demonstrating how technology can be harnessed to create more effective, efficient, and humane solutions to complex global challenges.\n"},{"uri":"https://dophucduy.github.io/AWS_InternshipReport_FCJ/3.-translated-blogs/","title":" Translated Blogs","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Translated Blogs Technical blog translations and knowledge sharing content\n3.1 AWS Big Data Blog - OpenSearch Serverless Monitoring A comprehensive guide to implementing CloudWatch monitoring for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collections.
