##  Microservice Architecture
Techcombank's journey from monolithic to microservices architecture demonstrated significant improvements in scalability and maintainability. The session covered containerization strategies using AWS ECS and EKS.

##  Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
VPBank's implementation of DDD principles in their cloud modernization project showed how proper domain modeling can accelerate development cycles and improve code quality.

##  Event-Driven Architecture
Renova Cloud's presentation on integrating event-driven patterns with AWS EventBridge and Lambda functions provided practical insights into building resilient, loosely-coupled systems.

##  Compute Evolution
The evolution from traditional EC2 instances to serverless computing with Lambda and containerized workloads on Fargate represents a paradigm shift in how we approach application deployment.

##  Amazon Q Developer
AI-powered development assistant that helps with code generation, debugging, and optimization. The demo showed 40% improvement in development velocity when integrated into existing workflows.

##  Lessons Learned
### Design Thinking
- GenAI integration requires careful consideration of data privacy and security
- User-centric design principles apply equally to AI-powered applications
- Iterative development approach works best for AI/ML implementations

### Technical Architecture
- Microservices enable better GenAI integration at service boundaries
- Event-driven architecture supports real-time AI processing workflows
- Proper observability is crucial for AI-powered systems

### Modernization Strategy
- Start with pilot projects to validate GenAI use cases
- Invest in team training and change management
- Establish clear governance frameworks for AI implementations

##  Practical Applications
- Implementing automated code review using Amazon Q Developer
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines with AI-powered testing
- Deploying intelligent monitoring solutions with CloudWatch Insights
- Creating event-driven architectures for real-time data processing

##  Personal Experience & Reflections
