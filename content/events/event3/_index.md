## Modern Data Resiliency
Evolution from traditional backup solutions to cloud-native resiliency strategies, emphasizing immutable backups and automated recovery processes.

## Cyber Resilience Framework
Comprehensive approach to protecting against ransomware and cyber threats using AWS security services and Commvault's advanced protection capabilities.

## AWS Backup Integration
Deep dive into AWS Backup service capabilities, cross-region replication, and integration with third-party solutions like Elastio for enhanced data protection.

## Immutable Storage Solutions
Implementation of immutable backup strategies using AWS S3 Object Lock and Glacier for long-term data retention and compliance requirements.

## Automated Recovery Processes
Demonstration of automated disaster recovery workflows, including isolated testing environments and rapid recovery procedures for business continuity.

## Lessons Learned
### Data Protection Strategy
- Transition from traditional backup to cloud-native resiliency requires comprehensive planning
- Immutable backups are essential for ransomware protection
- Regular testing of recovery procedures ensures business continuity

### Technical Implementation
- AWS Backup provides centralized management for multiple AWS services
- Elastio enhances AWS Backup with advanced monitoring and analytics
- Cross-region replication ensures geographic disaster recovery

### Governance and Compliance
- Automated compliance reporting reduces administrative overhead
- Data lifecycle management optimizes storage costs
- Regular audit trails maintain regulatory compliance

## Practical Applications
- Implementing AWS Backup for EC2, RDS, and EFS resources
- Setting up Elastio integration for enhanced backup monitoring
- Creating automated disaster recovery runbooks
- Establishing data retention policies for compliance requirements

## Personal Experience & Reflections
