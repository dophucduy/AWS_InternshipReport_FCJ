# Deploying the Flyora E-commerce System on AWS

### Overview

In this workshop, you will deploy the core components of the **Flyora** platform using a **Serverless** architecture on AWS.  
The objective is to build a system that is scalable, cost-efficient, and easy to maintain.

Components to be deployed:

- **Frontend**: Store & deliver UI via **S3 + CloudFront**
- **Backend API**: Handle business logic with **API Gateway + AWS Lambda**
- **Database**: Manage product / order data using **DynamoDB + S3**
- **User Authentication**: Implemented via **Amazon Cognito**
- **Chatbot**: Product consultation assistant integrated into UI (handled by AI Team)

The workshop is divided into group roles for parallel development:
**Backend (BE), AI (Chatbot), and Frontend (FE)**.
